                  ------------------------------------------ N+ Networking ------------------------------------------
Network A computer network is a group of computers connected to communicate and share resources such as a file, printer, email, etc.

*A computer network is a system that connects numerous independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily.


*A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems. A network connection can be established using either cable or wireless media. Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.

----------------------Network types-----------------------------------------

1. Personal area network (PAN)

2. Local area network (LAN)

3. Metropolitan area network (MAN)

4. Campus area network (CAN)

5. Wide area network  (WAN)


1.Personal area network

 A personal area network (PAN) is the smallest and simplest type of network. PANs connect devices within the range of an individual and are no larger than about 10 meters (m). Because PANs operate in such limited areas of space, most are wireless and provide short-range connectivity with infrared technology.

           * example of a wireless PAN is when users connect Bluetooth devices, like wireless headsets, to a smartphone or laptop      10 meters or 33 feet

2.Local area network
    A local area network (LAN) is a system where computers and other devices connect to each other in one location. 1 KM to 10 KM

*Wired LANs use physical cables, like Ethernet, and switches ; WLANs use devices, like wireless routers and access points.

 LANs support home offices and corporate network environments, among others.

*Employees in company offices can quickly communicate, share and access the same data and services provided by their organization.


3.Metropolitan area network

 *A metropolitan area network (MAN) is an interconnection of several LANs throughout a city, town or municipality. 


*The main purpose of a MAN is to have the same network available in several locations. In a LAN, the network is accessible in one location.   5 kilometers to 50 km.

4.Campus area  network 

*campus network, sometimes referred to as a campus area network or CAN, is a network of interconnected, dispersed LANs. Like MANs, campus networks extend coverage to buildings close in proximity

*The geographical range of a campus network varies from 1 kilometer to 5 km, while MANs can extend to 50 km.

5. Wide area network

   *wide area network (WAN) is the most expansive type of computer network configuration.

    *world's most popular and largest WAN -- today.  100KM  1000 km.


internet
--------

     the internet is the single largest want linking private even continued, and Organizations in the world. 

*The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks -- a network of networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers).


intranet
--------

    * intranet is a private network contained within an enterprise that is used to securely share company information and computing resources among employees. An intranet can also be used for working in groups and teleconferences. Intranets encourage communication within an organization.



extranets
---------

    *Companies use extranets to give customers or vendors access to secure information. It’s a way to share and collaborate with them. 
If you have a customer who places regular orders from your business, you can create a secure extranet that lets them update orders, process invoices, and message your team.


  

Unicast
-------

Unicast is the term used to describe communication where a piece of information is sent from one point to another point. 
All LANs (e.g. Ethernet) and IP networks support the unicast transfer mode, and most users are familiar with the standard unicast applications 

ex  http, smtp, ftp and telnet) which employ the TCP transport protocol.


Broadcast
---------

Broadcast is the term used to describe communication where a piece of information is sent from one point to all other points. 
In this case there is just one sender, but the information is sent to all connected receivers.

--------Types Of broadcasting----------

1.Limited Broadcasting (Within a Network)

2.direct Broadcasting (Over Other Network)

Multicast
---------
In this case there is may be one or more senders, and the information is distributed to a set of receivers 
(the may be no receivers, or any other number of receivers).

Ex; sending message to WhatsApp Group 
 


topology 
--------

types of topology

1.Bus Topology

2.Star Topology

3.Ring Topology

4.Mesh Topology

5.Hybrid Topology

6.Tree Topology



1.Bus Topology
              
              *In case of Bus topology, all devices share single communication line or cable.
      
              *Bus topology may have problem while multiple hosts sending data at the same time


             
2.Star Topology


        * All hosts in Star topology are connected to a central device, known as hub device, using a point-to-point connection. 

        * That is, there exists a point to point connection between hosts and hub. The hub device can be any of the following.
 
        *  As in Bus topology, hub acts as single point of failure.



3.Ring Topology

           * In ring topology, each host machine connects to exactly two other machines, creating a circular network structure.

           * To connect one more host in the existing structure, the administrator may need only one more extra cable.


4.Mesh Topology
         
          *In this type of topology, a host is connected to one or multiple hosts.

          *This topology has hosts in point-to-point connection with every other host or may also have hosts which are in point-to-point connection to few hosts only.



5.Hybrid Topology

              *A network structure whose design contains more than one topology is said to be hybrid topology. 
 
              *Hybrid topology inherits merits and demerits of all the incorporating topologies.

              *Most WANs are connected by means of Dual-Ring topology and networks connected to them are mostly Star topology networks. 

              *Internet is the best example of largest Hybrid topology.





what is Bootstrap Protocol
--------------------------

(Bootstrap Protocol) is an internet protocol that lets a network user automatically be configured to receive an 
IP address and have an operating system booted without user involvement.



Transmission modes
------------------


The  way in Which data in transmission from one device to another device is known as transmission mode'

The Transmission mode I Also Know as the Communication mode. 

Transmission mode  types
--------------------------

1. Simplex,       2 Duplex   -- Half Duplex , Full Duplex




1.simplex
   
    *One -Way  communication  
    
   *A Device can only send the data but cannot receive it or it can receive the data.
 
 EX: TV, Radio keyboard and Monitor



duplex
-------   
1.Holf - duplex

     *send are Receive Data

     * Data flow in both the  directions, but not at the same time.

EX: Walkie-talkie
 

2.Full - duplex

             *Tow -Way communication and two -way Transmission.

             *Both the Stations can send Receive the Data simultaneously

2. physical address


 *IP Address is internet protocol Address.

 *it is a unique address used to identify a device in the IP network.
 
 * 2 versions of ip address
               
            1. ipv4 32 bits
  
            2. ipv6 128 bits


2 types of ip Address
--------------------

public ip  

private ip   


ip address can be divided in to  two portions
----------------------------------------------

Network portion

host portion


ipv4 Address:
------------


  *it is made up of 32 binary bits.

  * 32 binary bits are broken in to 4 octets (1 octal =8 bits) and converted in to decimals.

  * the value of each Octal ranges from 0 to 255 in decimal or 00000000-11111111 in binary

  * The decimal Format of ipv4 address is 192.168.10.11

  *Subnet is an logical subdivision of an ip network. Dividing, dividing on ip network is subnetting.

  *Advantages of subnetting
          
            minimize broadcasting, secured



    subnet Mask is a 32 bit number that is used to identify network portion & host portion in the ip address


* it is made of putting all Network bit as "1" & host bit as "0"

* last octet is reserved for specific functions "0" indicates the Network address and "255" used to broadcast

Router Memory Components 
 
Cisco routers (and switches) generally contain four types of memory: 
•	ROM (Read-Only Memory) 
•	Flash 
•	NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM) 
•	RAM (Random-Access Memory) 

   

. RAM RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY
  
     RAM IS A VOLATILE MEMORY, AND THUS ITS CONTENTS WILL BE LOST IF THE ROUTER IS POWERED OFF

  
   NVRAM 
        IS WE WANT TO STORE A FILE PERMANENTLY, DATA WILL BE STORED IN NVRAM. DATA WILL BE STORED EVEN IS ROUTER GERS RELOADED


FLASH MEMORY
      
LIKE IN COMPUTERS, DATA & OPERATING SYSTEM BOTH GETS STORED IN HARD-DISK DRIVE
BUT IN CASE OF ROUTER, IOS INTER-NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM GETS STOORED IN FLASH MEMORY


ROM
    IT HELP TO PERFORM POST (POWER ON SELF-TEST)

      POST IS SUCESSFULLY DONE BY ROM , ONCE ROUTER IS POWERED ON & AFTER THAT ROUTER WILL START BOOTING.



The Router Boot-Process, Quick Reference
----------------------------------------- 
 
The following details the router boot process: 
 
1.	The router is powered on. 
 
2.	The bootstrap program (ROMmon) is loaded from ROM. 
 
3.	The bootstrap runs POST. 
 
4.	The bootstrap attempts to load the IOS from Flash. 

a.	If the IOS is not found in Flash, the bootstrap loads into RAM the basic IOS stored in ROM. 
b.	If the IOS is found in Flash, it is loaded into RAM. 
 
5.	The IOS attempts to load the startup-config file from NVRAM 

c.	If the startup-config is found in NVRAM, it is loaded into 
RAM. 
 
6.	The startup-config becomes the running-config in RAM. 
 


Using Lines to Configure the IOS
-------------------------------- 
 
As mentioned previously, three methods (or lines) exist to configure Cisco IOS devices: 
•	Console ports 
•	Auxiliary ports 
•	VTY (telnet) ports 
 

Console ports
--------------
Nearly every modern Cisco router or switch includes a console port, sometimes labeled on the device simply as con. The console port is generally a RJ-45 connector, and requires a rollover cable to connect to. The opposite side of the rollover cable connects to a PC’s serial port using a serial terminal adapter. 


Auxiliary port
---------------

Some Cisco devices include an auxiliary port, in addition to the console port. The auxiliary port can function similarly to a console port, and can be accessed using a rollover cable. Additionally, auxiliary ports support modem commands, thus providing dial-in access to Cisco devices. 

VTY (telnet) ports  Virtual teletype.
------------------

Telnet, and now SSH, are the most common methods of remote access to routers and switches. 




The Cisco IOS 
--------------

Cisco IOS
--------
   The Cisco IOS (Internetwork Operating System) is a command-line
interface used by nearly all current Cisco routers and Catalyst switches. The
IOS provides the mechanism to configure all Layer 2 and Layer 3 functions
on Cisco devices. 


The IOS is structured into several modes, which contain sets of commands
specific to the function of that mode




Router         #          show                  startup-config

 |             |            |                       |

Hostname     Mode        Command                 Argument 



By default, the first mode you enter when logging into a Cisco device is
User EXEC mode. User mode appends a “>” after the device hostname:

                  Router>

No configuration can be changed or viewed from User mode. Only basic
status information can be viewed from this mode.

Privileged EXEC mode allows all configuration files, settings, and status
information to be viewed. Privileged mode appends a “#” after the device
hostname:

             Router#

To enter Privileged mode, type enable from User mode:
 
             Router> enable
             Router#

To return back to User mode from Privileged mode, type disable:

             Router# disable
             Router>

Very little configuration can be changed directly from Privileged mode.
Instead, to actually configure the Cisco device, one must enter Global
Configuration mode:

            Router(config)#

To enter Global Configuration mode, type configure terminal from
Privileged Mode:

            Router# configure terminal
            Router(config)#

To return back to Privileged mode, type exit:

             Router(config)# exit
             Router# 




Routing Table Basics 
-------------------- 
 
Routing is the process of sending a packet of information from one network to another network. Thus, routes are usually based on the destination network, and not the destination host (host routes can exist, but are used only in rare circumstances). 
 
To route, routers build Routing Tables that contain the following: 
•	The destination network and subnet mask 
•	The “next hop” router to get to the destination network 
•	Routing metrics and Administrative Distance 
 
The routing table is concerned with two types of protocols: 
•	A routed protocol is a layer 3 protocol that applies logical addresses to devices and routes data between networks. Examples would be IP and IPX. 
•	A routing protocol dynamically builds the network, topology, and next hop information in routing tables. Examples would be RIP, IGRP, OSPF, etc. 
 
To determine the best route to a destination, a router considers three elements (in this order): 
•	Prefix-Length 
•	Metric (within a routing protocol) 
•	Administrative Distance (between separate routing protocols) 



Static vs. Dynamic Routing
--------------------------
There are two basic methods of building a routing table:                                                                                                                                                           
• Static Routing
• Dynamic Routing

Static Routing
--------------

A static routing table is created, maintained, and updated by a network
administrator, manually.

Static routing is a manual process. 

Static routing is used in smaller networks.


Dynamic routing
---------------

A dynamic routing table is created, maintained, and updated by a routing
protocol running on the router. Examples of routing protocols include RIP
(Routing Information Protocol), EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway
Routing Protocol), and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)                   
 


Classful vs Classless routing protocols
---------------------------------------
Classful routing protocols do not send subnet mask information with their
routing updates. A router running a classful routing protocol will react in one
of two ways when receiving a route.

          Examples of classful routing protocols include RIPv1 and IGRP. 

Classless routing protocols
----------------------------
Classlesss  protocols  send subnet mask information with their
routing updates. Thus, Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSMs) are allowed when using
classless routing protocols.  

      Examples of classless routing protocols include RIPv2, EIGRP, OSPF, and+
IS-IS. 


RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
---------------------------------
RIP is a standardized Distance Vector protocol, designed for use on smaller

networks. RIP was one of the first true Distance Vector routing protocols,

and is supported on a wide variety of systems.

RIP adheres to the following Distance Vector characteristics:

• RIP sends out periodic routing updates (every 30 seconds)
• RIP sends out the full routing table every periodic update
• RIP uses a form of distance as its metric (in this case, hop count)
• RIP uses the Bellman-Ford Distance Vector algorithm to determine
  the best “path” to a particular destination

Other characteristics of RIP include:

• RIP supports IP and IPX routing.
• RIP utilizes UDP port 520
• RIP routes have an administrative distance of 120.
• RIP has a maximum hop count of 15 hops.
Any network that is 16 hops away or more is considered unreachable to RIP,
thus the maximum diameter of the network is 15 hops. A metric of 16 hops
in RIP is considered a poison route or infinity metric. 


RIP Versions               
-------------
RIP has two versions, Version 1 (RIPv1) and Version 2 (RIPv2).
RIPv1 (RFC 1058) is classful, and thus does not include the subnet mask
with its routing table updates.

RIPv1 sends updates as broadcasts to address 255.255.255.255.


RIPv2 (RFC 2543) is classless, and thus does include the subnet mask with
its routing table updates. RIPv2 fully supports VLSMs, allowing                      
discontiguous networks and varying subnet masks to exist. 




RIPv2 can interoperate with RIPv1. By default
---------------------------------------------

• RIPv1 routers will sent only Version 1 packets
• RIPv1 routers will receive both Version 1 and 2 updates
• RIPv2 routers will both send and receive only Version 2 updates 



RIP Timers
-----------
RIP has four basic timers

Invalid Timer (default 180 seconds) – indicates how long a route will
remain in a routing table before being marked as invalid, if no new updates
are heard about this route.


Hold-down Timer
---------------
A route will enter a hold-down state for one of three reasons

• The invalid timer has expired.
• An update has been received from another router, marking that route
with a metric of 16 (or unreachable).
• An update has been received from another router, marking that route
with a higher metric than what is currently in the routing table. This is
to prevent loops. 


Flush Timer (default 240 seconds)
----------------------------------

indicates how long a route can remain

in a routing table before being flushed, if no new updates are heard about
this route. The flush timer runs concurrently with the invalid timer, and
thus will flush out a route 60 seconds after it has been marked invalid.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) 
--------------------------------
 
OSPF is a standardized Link-State routing protocol, designed to scale efficiently to support larger networks. 


OSPF adheres to the following Link State characteristics

*	OSPF employs a hierarchical network design using Areas. 

*	OSPF will form neighbor relationships with adjacent routers in the same Area

*       the status of directly connected links using Link-State Advertisements (LSAs). 

*	OSPF traffic is multicast either to address 224.0.0.5 (all OSPF routers) or 224.0.0.6 (all Designated Routers). 

*	OSPF uses the Dijkstra Shortest Path First algorithm to determine the shortest path.  

•	OSPF is a classless protocol and thus supports VLSMs    Variable Length Subnet Mask


Other characteristics of OSPF include: 
                               
•	OSPF supports only IP routing. 

•	OSPF routes have an administrative distance is 110. 


The OSPF process builds and maintains three separate tables 

*	A neighbor table – contains a list of all neighboring routers.  ROUTER ALL INFORMETION #SHOW IP OSPF NEIGHBOR

*	A topology table – contains a list of all possible routes to all known networks within an area. #SHOW IP OSPF topology

*	A routing table – contains the best route for each known network. #SHOW IP ROUTE

EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) bIGP INTER
---------------------------------------------------
EIGRP is a Cisco-proprietary Hybrid routing protocol, incorporating
features of both Distance-Vector and Link-State routing protocols.

EIGRP adheres to the following Hybrid characteristics
-----------------------------------------------------

• EIGRP uses Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to determine the
best path among all “feasible” paths. DUAL also helps ensure a loop free routing environment.

• EIGRP will form neighbor relationships with adjacent routers in the
same Autonomous System (AS).

• EIGRP traffic is either sent as unicasts, or as multicasts on address
224.0.0.10, depending on the EIGRP packet type.

• Reliable Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to ensure delivery of most
EIGRP packets.

• EIGRP routers do not send periodic, full-table routing updates.
Updates are sent when a change occurs, and include only the change.

• EIGRP is a classless protocol, and thus supports VLSMs.

Other characteristics of EIGRP include:  PDM  
---------------------------------------
• EIGRP supports IP, IPX, and Appletalk routing.

• EIGRP applies an Administrative Distance of 90 for routes originating
within the local Autonomous System.

• EIGRP applies an Administrative Distance of 170 for external routes
coming from outside the local Autonomous System

• EIGRP uses Bandwidth and Delay of the Line, by default, to
calculate its distance metric. It also supports three other parameters to
calculate its metric: Reliability, Load, and MTU  (maximum transmission unit).

• EIGRP has a maximum hop-count of 224, though the default
maximum hop-count is set to 100. 




Software-Defined Networking (SDN) 
----------------------------------

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach to networking that uses software-based 

controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with underlying hardware infrastructure and direct traffic on a network


SDN encompasses several types of technologies, including functional separation, network virtualization and automation through programmability. 

Originally, SDN technology focused solely on the separation of the network control plane from the data plane.




The three layers in an SDN architecture are

Application: The applications and services running on the network

Central: the SDN controller or "brains- of the network

Infrastructure: switches and Routes, and the supporting physical hardware

SDN Benefits
------------
Direct programmability
-----------------------
SDN network policy is directly programmable because the control functions are decoupled from forwarding functions, 
write enables the network to De programmatically 

configured by proprietary or open-source automation tools, including OpenStac:k- Puppet, Salt, Ansible, and Chet

Centralized management
---------------------

Network intelligence is logically centralized in SON software that maintains a global view Of the network, 
which shows 10 applications of SDN network policy engines as a Single. logical switch.





Network Address Translation
----------------------------
NAT (Network Address Translation)

The rapid growth of the Internet resulted in a shortage of available IPv4
addresses. In response, a specific subset of the IPv4 address space was
designated as private, to temporarily alleviate this problem.

A public address can be routed on the Internet. Thus, devices that must be
Internet-accessible must be configured with (or reachable by) public
addresses. Allocation of public addresses is governed by the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

A private address is intended for internal use within a home or
organization, and can be freely used by anyone. However, private addresses
can never be routed on the Internet. In fact, Internet routers are configured to
immediately drop traffic with private addresses.

Three private address ranges were defined in RFC 1918, one for each IPv4

class:
• Class A - 10.x.x.x /8
• Class B - 172.16.x.x /16
• Class C - 192.168.x.x /24

It is possible to translate between private and public addresses, using
Network Address Translation (NAT).



Types of NAT
------------
NAT can be implemented using one of three methods

Static NAT – performs a static one-to-one translation between two
addresses, or between a port on one address to a port on another address


Dynamic NAT – utilizes a pool of global addresses to dynamically translate
the outbound traffic of clients behind a NAT-enabled device.



NAT Overload or Port Address Translation (PAT) – translates the
outbound traffic of clients to unique port numbers off of a single global
address



NAT Terminology
----------------

Specific terms are used to identify the various NAT addresses

• Inside Local – the specific IP address assigned to an inside host
behind a NAT-enabled device (usually a private address).

• Inside Global – the address that identifies an inside host to the
outside world (usually a public address). Essentially, this is the
dynamically or statically-assigned public address assigned to a private
host.

• Outside Global – the address assigned to an outside host (usually a
public address).

• Outside Local – the address that identifies an outside host to the
inside network. Often, this is the same address as the Outside Global.
However, it is occasionally necessary to translate an outside (usually
public) address to an inside (usually private) address. 



Dynamic NAT CMD
----------------

Router(config)#int gig0/0
Router(config-if)#ip nat inside
Router(config-if)#exit
Router(config-if)#int gig0/1
Router(config-if)#ip nat outside
Router(config-if)#exit
Router(config)#access-list 10 permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
Router(config)# ip nat pool red 192.168.10.1 192.168.10.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
Router(config)# ip nat inside source list 10 pool red


IPv6 offers the following features
----------------------------------

• Increased Address Space and Scalability – providing the absurd
number of possible addresses stated previously.

• Simplified Configuration – allows hosts to auto-configure their IPv6
addresses, based on network prefixes advertised by routers.

• Integrated Security – provides built-in authentication and encryption
into the IPv6 network header

• Compatibility with IPv4 – simplifies address migration, as IPv6 is
backward-compatible with IPv4


The IPv6 Address
---------------
The IPv6 address is 128 bits, as opposed to the 32-bit IPv4 address. Also
unlike IPv4, the IPv6 address is represented in hexadecimal notation,
separate by colons. 

An example of an IPv6 address would be 


1254:1532:26B1:CC14:0123:1111:2222:3333


IPv6 always use CIDR notation to determine what bits notate the prefix of
an address:

Full Address: 1254:1532:26B1:CC14:123:1111:2222:3333/64
Prefix ID: 1254:1532:26B1:CC14
Host ID: 123:1111:2222:3333 

The /64 indicates that the first 64 bits of this address identify the prefix




We can drop any leading zeros in each field of an IPv6 address. For
example, consider the following address

1423:0021:0C13:CC1E:3142:0001:2222:3333



Only leading zeros can be condensed. If we have an entire field comprised of
zeros, we can further compact the following address.

F12F:0000:0000:CC1E:2412:1111:2222:3333

The condensed address would be: F12F::CC1E:2412:1111:2222:3333.

Notice the double colons (::). We can only condense one set of contiguous
zero fields.

ip v6
-----

The address space that has been allocated is organized into several types,
determined by the high-order bits of the first field.

• Special Addresses – addresses begin 00xx:
• Link Local – addresses begin FE8x:
• Site Local – addresses begin FECx:
• Aggregate Global – addresses begin 2xxx: or 3xxx:
• Multicasts – addresses begin FFxx:
• Anycasts

(Note: an “x” indicates the value can be any hexadecimal number)

There are no broadcast addresses in IPv6. Thus, any IPv6 address that is
not a multicast is a unicast address.

Anycast addresses identify a group of interfaces on multiple hosts. Thus,
multiple hosts are configured with an identical address. Packets sent to an
anycast address are sent to the nearest (i.e., least amount of hops) host.





Special (Reserved) IPv6 Addresses
---------------------------------

0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 (or ::) – is an unspecified or unknown address. It is
the equivalent of the IPv4 0.0.0.0 address


0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 (or ::1) – is the loopback or localhost address. It is
the equivalent of the IPv4 127.0.0.1 address.



Reserved Addresses - IPv4 and IPv6 Compatibility
-------------------------------------------------

To alleviate the difficulties of immediately migrating from IPv4 to IPv6,
specific reserved addresses can be used to embed an IPv4 address into an
IPv6 address.

Two types of addresses can be used for IPv4 embedding, IPv4-compatible
IPv6 addresses, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

• 0:0:0:0:0:0:a.b.c.d (or ::a.b.c.d) – is an IPv4-compatible IPv6
address. This address is used on devices that support both IPv4 and
IPv6. A prefix of /96 is used for IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses:

                    ::192.168.1.1/96

• 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:a.b.c.d (or ::FFFF:a.b.c.d) – is an IPv4-mapped
IPv6 address. This address is used by IPv6 routers and devices to
identify non-IPv6 capable devices. Again, a prefix of /96 is used for
IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses:

              ::FFFF:192.168.1.1/96


Site Local IPv6 Addresses.
--------------------------

Site-local IPv6 addresses are the equivalent of “private” IPv4 addresses.


The first field of a site-local IPv6 address will always begin FECx (1111
1110 11




Aggregate Global IPv6 Addresses
--------------------------------

Aggregate Global IPv6 addresses are the equivalent of “public” IPv4
addresses. Aggregate global addresses can be routed publicly on the Internet. 



Multicast IPv6 Addresses
------------------------

Multicast IPv6 addresses are the equivalent of IPv4 multicast addresses


The first field of a multicast IPv6 address will always begin FFxx (1111
1111)


Access Control Lists (ACLs) by naresh m

-----------------------------

Access control lists (ACLs) can be used for two purposes on Cisco devices

• To filter traffic
• To identify traffic

Access lists are a set of rules, organized in a rule table. Each rule or line in
an access-list provides a condition, either permit or deny.

• When using an access-list to filter traffic, a permit statement is used to
“allow” traffic, while a deny statement is used to “block” traffic.

• Similarly, when using an access list to identify traffic, a permit
statement is used to “include” traffic, while a deny statement states
that the traffic should “not” be included. It is thus interpreted as a
true/false statement. 


Types of Access Lists
---------------------

There are two categories of access lists: numbered and named.


Numbered access lists are broken down into several ranges, each dedicated
to a specific protocol: 


1–99 IP standard access list
100-199 IP extended access list

Named

Named access lists provide a bit more flexibility. Descriptive names can be
used to identify your access-lists

Standard IP Access List
-----------------------

Standard IP access-lists are based upon the source host or network IP
address, and should be placed closest to the destination network.


Extended IP Access List
------------------------

Extended IP access-lists block based upon the source IP address, destination
IP address, and TCP or UDP port number. Extended access-lists should be
placed closest to the source network.


What is a network switch

A network switch connects devices within a network (often a local area network, or LAN*) 
and forwards data packets to and from those devices. Unlike a router, a switch only sends data to the 
single device it is intended for (which may be another switch, a router, or a user's computer), 
not to networks of multiple devices


* In the context of computer networking, a "switch" refers to a networking device that connects multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) or sometimes at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.

* They use MAC addresses to forward data to the appropriate destination device within the same network segment.

MAC Address Learning
---------------------
            
Switches learn the MAC addresses of devices connected to each of their ports. They maintain a MAC address table (also known as a forwarding table or CAM table) that maps MAC addresses to the corresponding switch ports.

Forwarding
-----------

When a switch receives a frame (data packet) from a device, it looks up the destination MAC address in its MAC address table to determine the outgoing port for that address. It then forwards the frame only to the port where the destination device is connected, rather than broadcasting it to all ports as a hub would.

Frame Filtering
---------------

Switches filter traffic based on MAC addresses. Frames destined for devices connected to a specific port are only forwarded to that port, improving network efficiency and security.

Full Duplex
------------

Switches support full-duplex communication, allowing data to be transmitted and received simultaneously on each port. This enhances network performance compared to hubs, which operate in half-duplex mode.

VLAN Support
-------------

Many switches support Virtual LANs (VLANs), which allow networks to be logically segmented into multiple virtual networks, improving network management, security, and traffic isolation.

Virtual LANs (VLANs) by naresh m

-------------------

By default, a switch will forward both broadcasts and multicasts out every
port but the originating port. However, a switch can be logically segmented
into separate broadcast domains, using Virtual LANs (or VLANs).



Each VLAN represents a unique broadcast domain
---------------------------------------------

• Traffic between devices within the same VLAN is switched.

• Traffic between devices in different VLANs requires a Layer-3
  device to communicate. 



Advantages of VLANs
-------------------
VLANs provide the several benefits:

• Broadcast Control – eliminates unnecessary broadcast traffic,
improving network performance and scalability.

• Security – logically separates users and departments, allowing
administrators to implement access-lists to control traffic between
VLANs.

• Flexibility – removes the physical boundaries of a network, allowing
a user or device to exist anywhere


VLAN Port Types
---------------

A VLAN-enabled switch supports two types of ports:

• Access ports
• Trunk ports

*An access port is a member of only a single VLAN. Access ports are most
often used to connect host devices, such as computers and printers. By
default on Cisco switches, all switch ports are access ports.

*Any host connected to an access port immediately becomes a member of the
VLAN configured on that port. This is transparent to the host - it is unaware
that it belongs to a VLAN



VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
----------------------------

Maintaining a consistent VLAN database can be difficult in a large
switching environment.

Cisco’s proprietary VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) simplifies this
management - updates to the VLAN database are propagated to all switches
using VTP advertisements.

VTP requires that all participating switches join a VTP domain. Switches
must belong to the same domain to share VLAN information, and a switch
can only belong to a single domain



VTP Modes
---------A switch using VTP must operate in one of three modes.
• Server
• Client
• Transparent

VTP servers
----------- 
VTP servers are responsible for creating, deleting, or modifying entries in
the VLAN database. Each VTP domain must have at least one VTP server,
and this is the default mode for Cisco switches. 


VTP clients
-----------
VTP clientcannot modify the VLAN database, and rely on advertisements
from other switches to update VLAN information. A client will also forward
VTP advertisements out every trunk port. 

VTP transparent
---------------

A VTP transparent switch maintains its own local VLAN database, and
does not directly participate in the VTP domain. A transparent switch will
never accept VLAN database information from another switch, even a
server. Also, a transparent switch will never advertise its local VLAN
database to another switch. 




Switch Port Security
--------------------

Port Security adds an additional layer of security to the switching network.

The MAC address of a host generally does not change. If a specific host will
always remain connected to a specific switch port, then the switch can filter
all other MAC addresses on that port using Port Security.

Port Security supports both statically mapping MAC addresses, and
dynamically learning addresses from traffic sent on the port


Only hosts configured with the above two MAC addresses will be allowed to
send traffic through this port.

If the maximum number of MAC addresses for this port had been set to 10,
but only two were statically mapped, the switch would dynamically learn the
remaining eight MAC addresses.

Port Security refers to dynamically learned MAC addresses as sticky
addresses. Sticky addresses can be aged out after a period of inactivity,
measured in minute


A violation occurs if an unauthorized MAC address attempts to forward
traffic through a port. 

• Shutdown – If a violation occurs, the interface is placed in an
errdisable state. The interface will stop forwarding all traffic,
including non-violating traffic, until it is removed from an errdisable
state. This is the default action for Port Security.

• Restrict – If a violation occurs, the interface will remain online.
Legitimate traffic will be forwarded, and unauthorized traffic will be
dropped. Violations are logged, either via a syslog message or SNMP
trap.

• Protect – If a violation occurs, the interface will remain online.
Legitimate traffic will be forwarded and unauthorized traffic will be
dropped, but no logging will occur




Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
----------------------------

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) was developed to prevent the broadcast
storms caused by switching loops. STP was originally defined in IEEE
802.1D.

Switches running STP will build a map or topology of the entire switching
network.

A blocked port can be reactivated if another port goes down. This allows
STP to maintain redundancy and fault-tolerance.

However, because ports are blocked to eliminate loops, STP does not
support load balancing unless an EtherChannel is used. 

STP switches exchange Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU’s) to build the
topology database. 

STP is enabled by default on all Cisco switches, for all VLANs. 



Building the STP topology is a multistep convergence process..

• A Root Bridge is elected
• Root ports are identified
• Designated ports are identified
• Ports are placed in a blocking state as required, to eliminate loops


Electing an STP Root Bridge
-----------------------------
The first step in the STP convergence process is electing a Root Bridge,
which is the central reference point for the STP topology. As a best practice,
the Root Bridge should be the most centralized switch in the STP topology.
A Root Bridge is elected based on its Bridge ID, comprised of two

components in the original 802.1D standard
------------------------------------------
• 16-bit Bridge priority
• 48-bit MAC address


Identifying Root Ports
----------------------
The second step in the STP convergence process is to identify root ports.

The root port of each switch has the lowest root path cost to get to the Root
Bridge.

Each switch can only have one root port. The Root Bridge cannot have a
root port, as the purpose of a root port is to point to the Root Bridge. 


Identifying Designated Ports
-----------------------------

The third step in the STP convergence process is to identify designated
ports. 

A single designated port is identified for each network segment. This
port is responsible for forwarding BPDUs and frames to that segment.

If two ports are eligible to become the designated port, then there is a loop.
One of the ports will be placed in a blocking state to eliminate the loop. 



STP Port States
---------------

As STP converges the switching topology, a switch port will progress
through a series of states

• Blocking
• Listening
• Learning
• Forwarding
. Disable 

Initially, a switch port will start in a blocking state
--------------------------------------------------------

• A blocking port will not forward frames or learn MAC addresses.

• A blocking port will still listen for BPDUs from other switches, to
learn about changes to the switching topology. 

listening port
--------------

• A listening port will not forward frames or learn MAC addresses.
• A listening port will send and listen for BPDUs, to participate in the
election of the Root Bridge, root ports, and designated ports. 

learning port
------------
• A learning port will continue to send and listen for BPDUs.
• A learning port will begin to add MAC addresses to the CAM table. 



forwarding port 
-----------------
 
• A port must wait another forward delay before transitioning from
learning to forwarding.

• A forwarding port is fully functional – it will send and listen for
BPDUs, learn MAC addresses, and forward frames. 


. Disable 
---------

 . This port will not participate in the STP operations




CLASSLESS INTER DOMAIN ROUTING     CIDR by naresh m
----------------------------------------


What is CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing or supernetting)? CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing or supernetting) 
is a method of assigning IP addresses that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on Class A, Class B and Class C networks.


subnetting
---------

subnetting is the process of creating a new network or subnets

the default subnet mask 255.255.255.0 the binary number for

11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
